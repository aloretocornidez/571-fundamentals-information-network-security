Given an encrypted text file, the task at hand for Lab 1: Task 1 was to decrypt
it using frequency analysis.

## Task 1 
### Encrypted File

Below is an excerpt of the encrypted text file:

```

```

### Performing Frequency Analysis on the Input

The first task to perform frequency analysis is checking the most common
occurring letters, bigrams and trigrams. This analysis can be performed on the
encrypted text by running the following python script (provided by the creator
of this lab assignment). This script just calculates and prints the n-grams
contained in a file input stream.

```python
# Generate all the n-grams for value n
def ngrams(n, text):
    for i in range(len(text) -n + 1):
        # Ignore n-grams containing white space
        if not re.search(r'\s', text[i:i+n]):
           yield text[i:i+n]

# Read the data from the ciphertext
with open('ciphertext.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()

# Count, sort, and print out the n-grams
for N in range(N_GRAM):
   print("-------------------------------------")
   print("{}-gram (top {}):".format(N+1, TOP_K))
   counts = Counter(ngrams(N+1, text))        # Count
   sorted_counts = counts.most_common(TOP_K)  # Sort
   for ngram, count in sorted_counts:
       print("{}: {}".format(ngram, count))   # Print
```

---

Running this analysis on the encrypted text gives the following output:

```
-------------------------------------
1-gram (top 5):
n: 488
y: 373
v: 348
x: 291
u: 280
-------------------------------------
2-gram (top 5):
yt: 115
tn: 89
mu: 74
nh: 58
vh: 57
-------------------------------------
3-gram (top 5):
ytn: 78
vup: 30
mur: 20
ynh: 18
xzy: 16
```

---

From this information, we can then take the most common characters, bigrams and
trigrams in the english language and make some informed hypotheses for the
plausible substitutions.

Below is a list of the most common
[bigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram#Bigram_frequency_in_the_English_language),
and [trigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram#Frequency) in the english
language. We can assume that vowels are fairly common relative to non-vowels.

Bigrams:

```
th 3.56%
he 3.07%
in 2.43%
er 2.05%
an 1.99%
```

Trigrams:

```
the 	1.81%
and 	0.73%
tha 	0.33%
ent 	0.42%
ing 	0.72%
```

---

By combining the fact that the most common bigram is `th` and the most common
trigram is `the`, we can begin replacing the characters in the encrypted text
file.

### Character Substitution Using the `tr` Command

To substitute the letters in a quick way, we can use the `tr` utility. The `tr`
utility allows the translation or deletion of characters in a given input
stream.

In this case, we can use a simple bash script that contains a cipher and a key
and pipe the input file through the `tr` utility.

Here is the initial bash command used to replace the lowercase encrypted `ytn`
to an uppercase plaintext `THE`.

```bash
tr 'ytn' 'THE' < in.txt  > out.txt
```

From this command we can turn the previously shown except from:

---

```
qmruvimur ytnmh qzeexhy rxipnu rixgnq vyynupnnq qlvytnp ytncqnifnq mu givas
qexhynp iveni emuq vup qxzupnp xbb vgxzy qnkmqy exlnh mcgvivuanq bhxc ytn hnp
avheny vup ytn qyvrn xu ytn vmh n lvq aviinp xzy vgxzy evd munjzmyd vbynh
myq bxhcnh vuatxh avyy qvpinh jzmy xuan qtn invhunp ytvy qtn lvq cvsmur bvh
inqq ytvu v cvin axtxqy vup pzhmur ytn anhncxud uvyvimn exhycvu yxxs v gizuy
vup qvymqbdmur pmr vy ytn viicvin hxqynh xb uxcmuvynp pmhnayxhq txl axzip
ytvy gn yxeenp
```

To:

```
qmruvimur THEmh qzeexhT rxipEu rixgEq vTTEupEEq qlvTHEp THEcqEifEq mu givas
qexhTEp iveEi emuq vup qxzupEp xbb vgxzT qEkmqT exlEh mcgvivuaEq bhxc THE hEp

vup qvTmqbdmur pmr vT THE viicviE hxqTEh xb uxcmuvTEp pmhEaTxhq Hxl axzip
THvT gE TxeeEp
```

---

From here, we can see that some of the words are actually transformed to "THE".
We can continue to analyze the text and begin to look for additional
substitutions to approach our plaintext. Continuing the pattern of entering
educated guesses it is possible to decipher more of the text:

```bash
tr 'ytnvupm' 'THEANDI' < in.txt > out.txt
```

Renders the following:

---

```
qIrNAiINr THEIh qzeexhT rxiDEN rixgEq ATTENDEEq qlATHED THEcqEifEq IN giAas
qexhTED iAeEi eINq AND qxzNDED xbb AgxzT qEkIqT exlEh IcgAiANaEq bhxc THE hED

AND qATIqbdINr DIr AT THE AiicAiE hxqTEh xb NxcINATED DIhEaTxhq Hxl axziD
THAT gE TxeeED
```

---

Continuing that same approach to completion renders the `tr` command that
contains the following cipher/key solution:

```bash
tr 'ytnvupmsqxlichbzadgrjefokw' 'THEANDIKSOWLMRFUCYBGQPVJXC' < in.txt  > out.txt
```

Which renders the following plaintext:

```
SIGNALING THEIR SUPPORT GOLDEN GLOBES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELVES IN BLACK
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF ABOUT SEXIST POWER IMBALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STAGE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT ABOUT PAY INEQUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER QUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAKING FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURING THE CEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOK A BLUNT
AND SATISFYING DIG AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT BE TOPPED
```

---

The cipher and key can then be sorted to make it look nicer:


```
cipher: 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
key:    'CFMYPVBRLQXWIEJDSGKHNACOTU'
```


### Interesting Observations and Summary

When completing this assignment there were points that I had to backtrack
because I had incorrectly assigned a substitution to a character that was
faulty. However, thanks to having the ability to check my attempts in quick
succession, this did not slow down my progress by a large margin. However, I can
image that before computers were able to automate this substitution the
crypto-analyst had to be very careful with the substitutions they made when
breaking a cipher of this sort lest they face the agonizing pain of re-writing
the cipher with their new substitution attempt.

All in all, this lab was very fun. All of the commands were able to be run on my
computer as the commands used are part of the GNU utilities. To aid in my
completion of this assignment I made a backup of the text file and used output
redirection to a file `>` and `<`. This allowed me to test multiple attempts
quickly.







## Task 2 | Ciphers and Modes
Running the following commands we are able to encrypt the plaintext:

```sh

key="00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff"
iv="0102030405060708"


# create and save the files
openssl enc -aria-256-cbc -e -in plain.txt -out cipher.bin -K ${key} -iv ${iv} 
mv cipher.bin aria-256-cbc-cipher.bin

openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in plain.txt -out cipher.bin -K ${key} -iv ${iv} 
mv cipher.bin aes-128-cbc-cipher.bin

openssl enc -aes-128-cfb -e -in plain.txt -out cipher.bin -K ${key} -iv ${iv} 
mv cipher.bin aes-128-cfb-cipher.bin


# create a hexdump.
 hexdump aes-128-cbc-cipher.bin >> aes-128-cbc-cipher.hex
 hexdump aes-128-cfb-cipher.bin >> aes-128-cfb-cipher.hex
 hexdump aria-256-cbc-cipher.bin >> aria-256-cbc-cipher.hex


```

That gives the following three hexdumps (only the first 5 dumps are shown): 

```
# aes-128-cbc
0000000 0f3f d165 ae09 7199 a242 7bc6 e87b 9c32

```


## Task 3 | ECB vs CBC

### ECB Mode
When encrypting the image using ECB encoding with the following commands, (no need for an initialization vector):

```sh
# Encrypt the image contents. 
openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -e -in pic_original.bmp -out encrypted-image.bmp -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff

# get the header of the original image.
head -c 54 ./pic_original.bmp > header 

# get the body of the encrypted image.
tail -c +55 ./encrypted-image.bmp > body 

# Make make the new image.
cat header body > new-image-with-original-header.bmp

```

We get the following image:

![[Pasted image 20240214232602.png]]

### CFB Mode
However, when using CFB encryption, using the following script:

```sh
# Encrypt the image contents. 
openssl enc -aes-128-cfb -e -in pic_original.bmp -out encrypted-image.bmp -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
# openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -e -in pic_original.bmp -out encrypted-image.bmp -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff

# get the header of the original image.
head -c 54 ./pic_original.bmp > header 

# get the body of the encrypted image.
tail -c +55 ./encrypted-image.bmp > body 

# Make make the new image.
cat header body > new-image-with-original-header.bmp
```

We get the following image:

![[Pasted image 20240214232523.png]]

As we can see, when the image being used has a low frequency measurement, the encryption does not work as well when using ECB mode encryption. 

### Personal Image

When using a personal image, this is also the case with both ECB and CFB modes.

Original:
![[task-3-ecb-vs-cbc/Archlinux-icon-crystal-64.bmp]]

ECB Mode: 
![[Pasted image 20240214214717.png]]

CFB Mode:
![[Pasted image 20240214214800.png]]

## Task 4 | Padding 

The ECB mode does not require padding because there is no feedback from previously encrypted blocks in the encryption process.


Running my script: 

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create the files
echo -n "12345" > f1.txt 
echo -n "123456789a" > f2.txt 
echo -n "123456789abcdefg" > f3.txt 

# Encrypt the files.
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ./f1.txt -out ./5-bytes.txt  -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ./f2.txt -out ./10-bytes.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ./f3.txt -out ./16-bytes.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708

# Decrypt the files.
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in ./5-bytes.txt  -out ./p1.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in ./10-bytes.txt -out ./p2.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in ./16-bytes.txt -out ./p3.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708

# Decrypt the files using no pad
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -nopad -in ./5-bytes.txt  -out ./p1-no-pad.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -nopad -in ./10-bytes.txt -out ./p2-no-pad.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -nopad -in ./16-bytes.txt -out ./p3-no-pad.txt -K 00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff -iv 0102030405060708


# display the pad and nopad versios of the hexdump
output="padding-display"
filenames=("p1" "p2" "p3")

# empty file
echo -n "" > ${output}

# dump the hex contents into a file.
for file  in ${filenames[@]}; do
  echo "${file} padding" >> ${output}
  hexdump -C ./${file}.txt >> ${output}
  echo "${file} no padding" >> ${output}
  hexdump -C ./${file}-no-pad.txt >> ${output}
  echo  >> ${output}
done

# display the padding
clear && cat ${output}

# remove extranous files.
rm *.txt
```

We get the following output: 

```
p1 padding
00000000  31 32 33 34 35                                    |12345|
00000005
p1 no padding
00000000  31 32 33 34 35 0b 0b 0b  0b 0b 0b 0b 0b 0b 0b 0b  |12345...........|
00000010

p2 padding
00000000  31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 61                    |123456789a|
0000000a
p2 no padding
00000000  31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 61 06 06 06 06 06 06  |123456789a......|
00000010

p3 padding
00000000  31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 61 62 63 64 65 66 67  |123456789abcdefg|
00000010
p3 no padding
00000000  31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 61 62 63 64 65 66 67  |123456789abcdefg|
00000010  10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10  10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10  |................|
00000020
```

We can see that the block encrypts 16 bytes at a time, so the padding is done until bytes $\text{mod}(16)$ is zero.

## Task 5 | Error Propagation - Corrupted Cipher Text

Running my script: 

```sh
#!/bin/bash

key=00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff
iv=0102030405060708

# Generate the random file. if it doesn't exist.
if [ ! -f ./plaintext.txt ]; then
  head -n 100 /dev/random | strings | sed 's/[ \t]//g' > plaintext.txt
fi

## encrypt the file 
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ./plaintext.txt -out ./original-encrypted.txt  -K ${key} -iv ${iv}

# create a backup of the encrypted file.
cp ./original-encrypted.txt ./corrupted-encrypted.txt

# corrupt the file
sed -i '2s/[abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwxyz1234567890]/n/' ./corrupted-encrypted.txt

# decrypt the original encrypted file.
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in ./original-encrypted.txt -out ./original-decrypted.txt -K ${key} -iv ${iv}

# decrypt the corrupted encrypted file.
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -in ./corrupted-encrypted.txt -out ./corrupted-decrypted.txt -K ${key} -iv ${iv} 

# generate the hexdumps
hexdump ./corrupted-decrypted.txt > ./corrupted-decrypted.temp
hexdump ./original-decrypted.txt > ./original-decrypted.temp

head -n 15 ./original-decrypted.temp > ./original-decrypted.hex
head -n 15 ./corrupted-decrypted.temp > ./corrupted-decrypted.hex

clear && diff ./corrupted-decrypted.hex ./original-decrypted.hex
```

Gives the following differences between the two texts:

```
10,11c10,11
< 0000090 5dd8 dae0 406d 4dcb ed56 8127 ef89 5b89
< 00000a0 547a 6c51 3047 460a 3f65 0a39 4562 6150
---
> 0000090 6376 0a2c 7b64 3922 7e27 6b0a 407c 5a0a
> 00000a0 547a 6c51 3047 460a 3f65 0a22 4562 6150
```

As you can see, only two blocks are actually affected. The error is fixed after the cipher 'synchronizes' itself again.

## Task 6 | Initialization Vectors

### Task 6.1

Using the following script to encrypt the same file twice (using the same key and iv): 

```sh
key1=00112233445566778889aabbccddeeff
key2=aabbccddeeff00112233445566778889
iv1=0102030405060708
iv2=0506070801020304

input="words"


# encrypt the same file using the same iv and key
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ${input} -out ./encrypted-iv1-k1.txt  -K ${key1} -iv ${iv1}
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ${input} -out ./encrypted-iv2-k1.txt  -K ${key1} -iv ${iv1}

# generate a hexdump of the files.
hexdump ./encrypted-iv1-k1.txt > ./encrypted-iv1-k1.hex
hexdump ./encrypted-iv2-k1.txt > ./encrypted-iv2-k1.hex

# compare the hex dumps
clear && echo diff && diff ./encrypted-iv1-k1.hex ./encrypted-iv2-k1.hex && echo diff
```

We get the following output:

```
diff
diff
```

Meaning that both of the files are the same. This means that the cbc encryption mode is deterministic. This could have security vulnerabilities.

#### Different IVs renders two files that are very different

In this case, the second of the two encryption commands are changed:

```sh
# encrypt the same file using the same iv and key
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ${input} -out ./encrypted-iv1-k1.txt  -K ${key1} -iv ${iv1}
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -e -in ${input} -out ./encrypted-iv2-k1.txt  -K ${key1} -iv ${iv2}
```

And the diff between those files is large:

![[Pasted image 20240214230302.png]]

The deterministic nature of the encryption algorithms means careful IV selection is paramount in order to ensure any form of security.


### Task 6.2 

Modifying the `sample_code.py` file to XOR the message and hex representation of the files as follows:

```py
#!/usr/bin/python3


# XOR two bytearrays
def xor(first, second):
    return bytearray(x ^ y for x, y in zip(first, second))


MSG = "This is a known message!"
HEX_1 = "a469b1c502c1cab966965e50425438e1bb1b5f9037a4c159"
HEX_2 = "bf73bcd3509299d566c35b5d450337e1bb175f903fafc159"


def main():

    # Convert ascii string to bytearray
    D1 = bytes(MSG, "utf-8")

    # Convert hex string to bytearray
    D2 = bytearray.fromhex(HEX_1)
    D3 = bytearray.fromhex(HEX_2)

    r1 = xor(D1, D2)  # generate keystream

    actualString = xor(r1, D3).decode()  # generate original text.
    print(actualString)  # print original text.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Gives the following otuput:

```
Order: Launch a missile!
```

If the IV is not updated, it is possible to decipher any message sent as long as the key does not change. This is due to the deterministic nature of the cipher allowing us to generate a keysteam that is then able to be XORed with the ciphertext to produce the plaintext.

### Task 6.3

We can generate the hex representations of "Yes" and "No" with the following code;

```py
yes = bytes("Yes", "utf-8").hex()  # get the hex representation of yes
no = bytes("No", "utf-8").hex()  # get the hex representation of no
# print the hex values from the ascii strings.
print(f"Yes: {yes}")  # 5965730d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d0d
print(f"No: {no}")    # 4e6f0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e0e
```

Note: The padding is different for a "Yes" guess and a "No" guess.

After that, we can run the container to get the values for the IVs and target ciphertext.



By guessing "No" the first time, we get the generated plaintext:
![[Pasted image 20240214231834.png]]

We can see that this guess does not match the ciphertext, so we did not get guess correctly. 


Restarting the container and getting a new ciphertext, we then guess yes:
