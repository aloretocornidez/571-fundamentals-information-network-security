## Task 1 : Generating Two Different Files with the Same MD5 Hash

I generated a prefix file, then I ran the md5collgen program and checked for differences.

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303142350.png)

Afterwards, I checked if they had the same m5dsum:


![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303142424.png)

We can see an identical md5sum for both program seven though they are not identical.

We can see that both programs are almost exactly the same except for a few bytes:

### Questions:
1. If the length of your prefix is not a multiple of 64, what is going to happen?
	1. If the length of the prefix is not 64 bytes, then zeroes get padded to the end of the the prefix.
2. Create a prefix file with exactly 64 bytes and run the collision tool again, and see what happens.
	1. I generated the following file and checked if the prefix was 64 bytes:

	2. Here is what the output was for the md5collgen program:

	3. Here is the diff between the hexdumps:

	![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303143947.png)
	
3. Are the data (128 bytes) generated by `md5collgen` completely different for the two output files? Please identify all the bytes that are different.
	1. Bytes 50, 60, 70, 90, a0, and b0 are the differing bytes.




## Task 2 | Understanding MD5's Property

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303145954.png)

I created a file as a suffix. Then I got the md5sums of the two binaries before. Then I appended the suffix that I created to both programs, then I checked the md5 sums for both of the new files. They do indeed match. This can be done with multip files where the hash for the files that will be appended match. Added the same suffix to the program makes both files have a matching hash after appending the suffix.

## Task 3 | Generating Two Executable Files with the Same MD5 Hash



First I created the following `main.c` file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char xyz[200] = {
    /* The actual contents of this array are up to you */
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41};

int main() {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
    printf("%x", xyz[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```

Then I found used the bless hex editor to find the location of the array in the binary.

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303150531.png)

We can see that the 'A' in the program starts at 0x3040 (12352 base 10).

This is already a multiple of 64, so I can add 128 to the number and generate the prefix and suffix:


![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303152858.png)

Then I used `md5collgen` to generate the files with the same hash:

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303153016.png)

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303153038.png)


Then I appended the suffix to both files to generate the new files with an identical hash.

![](./attachments/Pasted image 20240303153152.png)

As you can see, both files have the same hash.

## Task 4 | Generate Programs that Behave Differently

I created a simple program that checks two arrays and makes sure that both contents are the same.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char xyz[400] = {
    /* The actual contents of this array are up to you */
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,
    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,

    0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41,

Here is the script that I created to generate the two files from the given source file:
```c
# Generate two files that behave differently.


# generate my code.
gcc -o main ./main.c;


# Generate the prefix and suffix
head -c 12352 main > prefix
tail -c +12479 main > suffix

# generate the collision
../md5collgen -p prefix -o out1.bin out2.bin

md5sum out1.bin out2.bin

# store the P and Q
tail -c 128 out1.bin > P
tail -c 128 out2.bin > Q

head -c 288 suffix > suffix_1 
tail -c +416 suffix > suffix_2

cat ./prefix ./P ./suffix_1 ./P ./suffix_2 > a1.out 
cat ./prefix ./Q ./suffix_1 ./P ./suffix_2 > a2.out 
chmod +x a1.out a2.out 

# display the hashes
md5sum a1.out a2.out

echo "a1.out: "
./a1.out 

echo "a2.out: "
./a2.out 
```

And here is the output of the script:
